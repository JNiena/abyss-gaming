# Staff Structure

## Disclaimer
--------------------------------------------------------
Members can be pulled up through the hiearchy if all the kings see a sizable amount of potential in them. Anything from conversations held in the past to current contributions can be taken into account. These types of promotions are considered special cases and are exceptions to the requirements of each rank. We do this because we don't want any of our written requirements to limit the ability and potential of future staff. Our own personal evaluations of members are more important to consider than the strict requirements that we've set. This staff structure is subject to change. Nothing here is set in stone.

## Culture
--------------------------------------------------------
- A heart to accept others as if they were your own brothers and sisters.
- A heart to fight against what is wrong.
- A heart to forgive others for their mistakes.
- A heart to teach others to be better.
- A heart to pass on the torch.
