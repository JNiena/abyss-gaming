# Recruitment

## Disclaimer
--------------------------------------------------------
As a recruiter in Abyss, your job is to help expand our guild by recruiting new members and to expose our guild to the world.

## Discord
--------------------------------------------------------
__Here is the process for assigning roles to new members:__

1. After someone has joined, a message will pop up in the `#welcome` channel to alert you. Go to the `#role-request` channel to aid them.
2. In this channel, greet the user and ask them to answer the following questions:
	- What is your in-game username?
	- Are you planning to join Abyss or are you just visiting?
  - Do you need a plot in-game?
3. Patiently wait for the user to answer.
4. Take away the unassigned role.
5. Change the user's nickname to their in-game username.
6. If they are planning to join Abyss, assign them the member role. Otherwise, assign them the guest role.
7. Show the user around the server and explain how the credit system, management, and culture work.

__For members that do not have Discord. Follow the steps below:__

1. Explain to them how to download and install Discord.
2. Send them a friend request and then invite them to the server.

__Once all of the above is complete, take care of the following in-game:__

1. Add them to the party chat by using `/party invite (username)`.
2. If the user needs a plot, stand in the plot and use `/trust (username)`.
3. If they need access to any farms, you can also use the same command above to add them.

__Profit shops are shops that allow you to buy an item and sell it back for a higher price. Abyss has numerous profit shops, including:__

- `/pw AbyssIG` which has iron and sugarcane drops.
- `/pw AbyssCF` which has cactus and bee drops.
- `/pw AbyssPF` which has gold and slime drops.
- `/pw AbyssPM` which has melon and pumpkin drops.
- `/pw AbyssGF` which has guardian drops.
- `/pw AbyssAF` which has passive mob drops.
- `/pw AbyssML` which has miscellaneous monster drops.

You need to explain these profits shops to new recruits.

__Places to tour new recruits:__

- `/pw Abyss` which has basic crafting stations, auto-smelters, and member plots.
- `/pw AbyssMall` which has shops and XP grinders.
- `/pw AbyssPots` which has potions.

__Some common questions and answers:__

- If I forgot to set a home at my plot, how can I get back?
> Enter `/pw Abyss` and go up the bubble column. From here, you can find your plot.
- What if I still can't find my plot?
> Ask for help in the Discord server. Next time, be sure to set a home using `/sethome (name)`. If you can't set a home, just mark down the coordinates.
